## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ :)
- I'm a researcher working in Synbio and Membrane Biophysics.
- I write and adapt code to analyze data and satisfy my curiosity.
- Not a coding expert, just learning as I go
- Thanks to ChatGPT, I save a lot of time.
- I hope some of my code helps you too.

Tools I often use:
ChatGPT | ImageJ | R | Python
